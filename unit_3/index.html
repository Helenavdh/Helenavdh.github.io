						Hi, welcome! Like most people in their mid twenties I’m trying to figure my life out and what I want to be when I grow up (whilst avoiding the quarter life crisis) and realizing whatever that is will include a lot of travel!<br>

						I’m based in Australia and love gigs and festivals, exercise, eating and socializing alot. I participate in these things as much as possible whilst remaining somewhat healthy. So overall this page will be full of insights and tips on traveling, health, music and food with a side of some mental well being stuff occasionally because it’s good for ya soul.
